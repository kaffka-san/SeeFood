# Credits
The app is built using the following resources:

CoreML - A framework that lets you integrate machine learning models into your app.
InceptionV3 - A pre-trained image classification model used for predicting whether an image is a hot dog or not.

This app was built as part of doctor's Angela Yu course  https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp
